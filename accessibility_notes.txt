Accessibility required plugins

To get tab working well, enable the tabfocus plugin.  The following seems to be a good combination.
 
   tabfocus_elements: ':prev,:next',
    plugins : 'tabfocus',


Translations are stored in the theme under the accessibility comment.

The application will use a default aria label of Rich Text Area, or derive it from the defining element if it was specified there. 

Known Issues

Use Voice Over to move voice cursor and focus into TinyMCE and then tab or shift-tab out and back into the editor. The keyboard focus moves but the voice over focus does not. Probably should be in sync?

ToDo

Probably want to make a way of doing editor short cuts.

perhaps in the tinymce init settings have something like:
shortcuts : { 'ctrl-b', 'bold'} 

iFrame needs a keyboard shortcut to enable accessibility help.

alt-f10 to go to the toolbar
need navigation.

highlighting on navigation
