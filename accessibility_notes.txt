Accessibility required plugins

To get tab working well, enable the tabfocus plugin.  The following seems to be a good combination.
 
   tabfocus_elements: ':prev,:next',
    plugins : 'tabfocus',


Translations are stored in the theme under the accessibility comment.

The application will use a default aria label of Rich Text Area, or derive it from the defining element if it was specified there. 

Known Issues

Use Voice Over to move voice cursor and focus into TinyMCE and then tab or shift-tab out and back into the editor. The keyboard focus moves but the voice over focus does not. Probably should be in sync?

ToDo

Probably want to make a way of doing editor short cuts.
Should remove the shortcut text from the button titles as it makes it JAWS read things like "Bold left paren, control plus B, right paren, button". Better to put shortcuts in a single help document.

perhaps in the tinymce init settings have something like:
shortcuts : { 'ctrl-b', 'bold'} 

iFrame needs a keyboard shortcut to enable accessibility help. Also need to provide the accessibility help.

** Toolbar Requirements **
(from http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#toolbar)
If there are multiple toolbars there must be an aria-label property for each toolbar.
If there are many toolbars they should be placed in a container element with a role of "group".
Recommended to provide access to these functions via menubar and menus to avoid cluttering the user interface with a surplus of toolbars.

Keyboard Interaction
* Tba moves focus to the first enabled toolbar button
* A subsequent tab moves focus out of the toolbar
* Left arrow and right arrow keys navigate to the enabled buttons in the toolbar (direction may need to be adjusted in RTL languages)
* Disabled buttons may either be not focussable or focussable but read by the screen reader as disabled.

Make tabbing through toolbar buttons work correctly on Safari.  Currently tab moves to the next drop down but skips buttons.  We should be setting tabindex="0" on the parent toolbar and tabindex="-1" on each button, then manually manage the tab key within the toolbar.
	See http://wiki.codetalks.org/wiki/index.php/Docs/Keyboard_navigable_JS_widgets
	Seems to work OK on IE (you can tab to each button, but you can't skip over all the toolbar buttons)
	Also the tabfocus button is currently adding an onfocus listener only to buttons so if the first control on the toolbar is a drop box it doesn't move focus to the editor.
		- and if it is a button you can't tab to the first button because the tabfocus plugin will immediately move focus to the editor.

alt-f10 to go to the toolbar (but with issues caused by the tabfocus plugin as noted above)
