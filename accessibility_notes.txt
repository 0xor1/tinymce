Accessibility required plugins

To get tab working well, enable the tabfocus plugin.  The following seems to be a good combination.
 
   tabfocus_elements: ':prev,:next',
    plugins : 'tabfocus',


Translations are stored in the theme under the accessibility comment.

The application will use a default aria label of Rich Text Area, or derive it from the defining element if it was specified there. 

Known Issues

Use Voice Over to move voice cursor and focus into TinyMCE and then tab or shift-tab out and back into the editor. The keyboard focus moves but the voice over focus does not. Probably should be in sync?

ToDo

Probably want to make a way of doing editor short cuts.
Should remove the shortcut text from the button titles as it makes it JAWS read things like "Bold left paren, control plus B, right paren, button". Better to put shortcuts in a single help document.

perhaps in the tinymce init settings have something like:
shortcuts : { 'ctrl-b', 'bold'} 

iFrame needs a keyboard shortcut to enable accessibility help. Also need to provide the accessibility help.

alt-f10 to go to the toolbar
need navigation.
